# Moonshot: Exploring Space Missions

## Introduction

Moonshot is an educational app developed to deepen my understanding of SwiftUI, particularly in handling navigation, decoding JSON, and presenting complex data in an intuitive format. Inspired by the history of space exploration, this app showcases detailed information about NASA's Apollo missions, including astronauts and mission highlights.

## Project Description

### What the App Does

- **Functionality:** Moonshot provides users with an interactive timeline of NASA's Apollo space missions. Users can explore detailed views of each mission, including the launch date, crew members, and significant achievements. Additionally, the app offers profiles of astronauts, detailing their roles in various missions and personal achievements in space exploration.
- **Technologies Used:** Built with SwiftUI, Moonshot leverages advanced features such as `NavigationView`, and `ScrollView`. It employs JSON decoding to parse and present detailed mission data and astronaut profiles, enhancing the educational value of the app.

### Purpose and Learning

- **Objective:** The aim was to create an app that not only educates users about space missions but also serves as a platform to practice and showcase my skills in SwiftUI, particularly in creating complex UIs, navigating between views, and managing data. 
- **Challenges and Solutions:**
	- **Decoding JSON Data:** One significant challenge was decoding JSON files with different structures to extract the information needed for the app. To address this, I implemented a generic function capable of decoding any type of JSON file, regardless of its structure. This approach streamlined the data handling process, making the code more reusable and efficient for parsing various JSON formats containing details about missions and astronauts.
	- **Flexible Data Presentation:** Another challenge was designing the UI to allow users to view data either as a grid or a list, depending on their preference. To overcome this, I used SwiftUI's flexibility to create dynamic views that can switch between grid and list layouts. I implemented a toggle mechanism that lets users choose their preferred view mode, enhancing the app's usability and personalization.
- **Skills Gained:** This project significantly enhanced my proficiency in SwiftUI, particularly in data handling, UI design, and navigation. I also gained valuable experience in working with JSON data and transforming it into meaningful content within an app.
